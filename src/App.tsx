          When dental problems pop up, don't you wish you could just ask a
          dentist about it? <br></br>Whenever my family has dental questions,
          they pick up the phone and call me: What is this?<br></br> Why does it
          hurt? How do I fix it? Do I need an x-ray? Do I need to go see a
          dentist rightaway?
          <br></br>Unfortunately, most people have to actually GO to a dentists
          office to ask a dentist. <br></br>I created this Dental Symptom
          Checker so that anyone, anywhere can â€œget an answer <br></br>to their
          questionsâ€œ for FREE. You will find answers to tons of questions about
          a wide <br></br>
          variety of dental symptoms. Whether you are here in the DMV area or in
          Antarctica, <br></br>I hope that this dental symptom checker helps you
          to get an idea of what your <br></br>symptom might be and get the
          answers you need to be healthier!

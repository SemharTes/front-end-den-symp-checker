          When dental problems pop up, don't you wish you could just ask a
          dentist about it? Whenever my family has dental questions, they pick
          up the phone and call me: What is this? Why does it hurt? How do I fix
          it? Do I need an x-ray? Do I need to go see a dentist rightaway?
          <br></br>Unfortunately, most people have to actually GO to a dentists
          office to ask a dentist. created this Dental Symptom Checker so that
          anyone, anywhere can â€œget an answer to their questionsâ€œ for FREE. You
          will find answers to tons of questions about a wide variety of dental
          symptoms. Whether you are here in the DMV area or in Antarctica, I
          hope that this dental symptom checker helps you to get an idea of what
          your symptom might be and get the answers you need to be healthier!

      <h4>
        When dental problems pop up, don't you wish you could just ask a dentist
        about it? <br></br>Whenever my family has dental questions, they pick up
        the phone and call me: What is this?<br></br> Why does it hurt? How do I
        fix it? Do I need an x-ray? Do I need to go see a dentist rightaway?
        <br></br>Unfortunately, most people have to actually GO to a dentists
        office to ask a dentist. <br></br>I created this Dental Symptom Checker
        so that anyone, anywhere can â€œget an answer <br></br>to their questionsâ€œ
        for FREE. You will find answers to tons of questions about a wide{" "}
        <br></br>
        variety of dental symptoms. Whether you are here in the DMV area or in
        Antarctica, <br></br>I hope that this dental symptom checker helps you
        to get an idea of what your <br></br>symptom might be and get the
        answers you need to be healthier!
